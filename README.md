AIM
Battery Charging from Solar Panel using Cisco Packet Trace.

REQUIRED
PC ,CISCO SOFTWARE.

PROBLEM STATE MENT
Design and set up a battery system that charges the battery using energy from a solar panel
within Cisco Packet Tracer.


SCOPE OF SOLUTION
Demonstrates renewable energy charging in a simulated environment.
Helps learners understand IoT-based energy monitoring systems.
Can be extended to include Smart Homes, Smart Grids, and Energy Distribution Systems in Cisco Packet Tracer.


PROCEDURE
1.	Cisco Packet Tracer. This project demonstrates how renewable energy can be simulated in
2.	A solar panel is used to generate electrical energy.
3.	The generated energy is supplied to a battery for storage.
4.	The battery stores this energy and powers connected IoT devices.
5.	A Home Gateway is used to manage communication between IoT devices.
6.	The battery is connected to the Home Gateway for monitoring purposes.
7.	A Tablet PC is connected to the gateway to observe the battery status.
8.	This setup allows us to visualize how solar energy can be converted and stored.
9.	The Tablet displays the charge level of the battery in real time.
10.	The project represents a simple model of smart energy management using IoT.


RESULT
We have successfully simulated the Battery Charging from Solar Panel using Cisco Packet Tracer
